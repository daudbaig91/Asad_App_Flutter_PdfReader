# asad_quran_app

A new Flutter project.

Pdf viewer for a specific book (The quran) out of production in the 1980’s with certain features added on request. In this app I have used custom sliding/swiping fragments with BottomNavigationBa for navigation, used basic translating and rotating animation with floating buttons for an aesthetic look. Used the native_pdf_view library as it incorporated many pdf functionalities such as a smooth pinch zooming and fit. The app includes functionality such as bookmarks and chapters page where users can add data through custom dialog boxes saved using SqlfLite Databases, last read page is saved in shared preferences an access through a “resume” floating button. User can navigate to a page using search bar. In this program i have focused in fixing as many bugs and catching and filtering all type of user inputs for minimal crashing.

This project is a copy of my android project: (https://github.com/daudbaig91/AsadQuran_PdfReader)
but now developed for cross-platforms as requested by the client.

Thanks For Reading; //:)
